# These are the proposed schemas to introduce labels hierarchy for issues,
# there could be issues in any hierarchy label, An issue would be 
# rendered as a child of the greatest hierarchy label assigned to it.
#
# A new document would be needed in each repo to declare the hierarchy levels
# of a single resource, or in a separate repo in an org to declare a global
# hierarchy for all the repos in an organization.
#
# To create Labels in Gitea you need to fill three fields: name,
# description and color. The first two are specially usefull for the
# purpose of introducing these schemas.


# SCHEMA OPTION 1 ("infinite" containers)
#
# An actual label would have this metadata in Gitea:
#
# label:
#   name: cn/{slug-of-the-container}
#   description: {Name of the container}
#   color: {hex-color-code}
#
# The document to declare the schema would look like this:

containers:
  - name: crc
